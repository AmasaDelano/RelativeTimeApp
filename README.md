# Relative Time

See how time passes for people of different ages.

This app is based on the idea that **time appears to pass more quickly the older you are** ([relevant Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_perception#Changes_with_age)). So, if a year passes for someone in their 30s, it may seem like eight (30-year-old) years have passed for a four-year-old. Play around with it to figure out more relative time perceptions!
